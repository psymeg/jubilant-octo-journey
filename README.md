## Movielens Project -  Machine Learning Submission

### Introduction

For the 9th Course in the HarvardX Data Science course we have been asked to build a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset.

The movie recommendation system will predict movie ratings.

The Movielens data package can be found at [the MovieLens homepage](https://movielens.org/). 

MovieLens is a project run by GroupLens - a research lab run at the University of Minnesota in North America. MovieLens is a non-commercial collection of movie data and the main set of data contains over 20 million ratings for over 27,000 movies. In this project we are using the [10M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/).

Note: code in this package is written on Linux. If running on windows you may need to change the line endings. This code has not been tested on Windows.
